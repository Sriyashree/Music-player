# Music-Player
This is a basic music player screen, with controls for pause/play. It also has controls for the slider, where one can just drag the slider button to skip to a particular part of the song.

Here, HTML has been used to create the basic structure of the webpage, and CSS has been used to style the HTML elements. JavaScript has been used to dynamically render parts of the website, like changing the pause/play button symbol accordingly, and also for the slider to function.

This project is from the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtrFzoL1joI
